Command: gcc -Wall -o signal_demo signal_demo.c
Explanation: Compiles the C program signal_demo.c into an executable named signal_demo.

Command: ./signal_demo
Explanation: Runs the program where the parent process runs indefinitely. One child sends SIGTERM after 5 seconds and another child sends SIGINT after 10 seconds. The parent handles each signal differently and exits gracefully.

Signal Handling:
Explanation: SIGTERM triggers a graceful shutdown message, while SIGINT triggers an interrupt-specific message. Both signals are handled using a custom signal handler.

In Image 5, I manually sent a signal (SIGINT) to the parent process using the keyboard (CTRL + C) and observed how the program handles it.
